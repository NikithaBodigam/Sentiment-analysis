# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to classify tweets as positive or negative. It leverages the Sentiment140 dataset to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Motivation
The project aims to:
- Explore natural language processing techniques for decoding emotions in text
- Develop a tool for analyzing sentiments in social media content
- Apply advanced neural network architectures to real-world data
- Gain insights at the intersection of linguistics and machine learning

## Tools and Technologies
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Regular Expressions
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Other: String, Multiprocessing, Warnings

## Results
- Model accuracy on unseen data: 74.15%
- Potential overfitting observed (training accuracy plateau at ~75%)

## Future Improvements
1. Hyperparameter tuning to mitigate overfitting
2. Enhance data quality and quantity for better model performance
